# LangChain Advanced Learning Plan
*(For learners who already know Python, ML, and LLM fundamentals)*

---

## Objective
Build a deep understanding of LangChain and its ecosystem to create professional AI applications such as retrieval systems, intelligent agents, and LLM-powered APIs.

---

## 1. LangChain Fundamentals
- Understand LangChain architecture:
  - Components: Chain, Agent, Memory, Retriever
  - Core vs Community packages (`langchain-core`, `langchain-community`)
- Environment setup:
  - `.venv` virtual environment
  - Local model or API configuration
- Build your first chain using `LLMChain` and `PromptTemplate`

---

## 2. Prompt Engineering in LangChain
- `PromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate`
- Dynamic prompt generation using variables
- Structuring inputs and outputs (JSON, schema)
- Multi-turn prompts with context and memory

---

## 3. Chains: Building Logical Workflows
- Core types:
  - `LLMChain`
  - `SequentialChain`
  - `SimpleSequentialChain`
- Combining multiple chains into a pipeline
- Error handling and validation
- Debugging with `verbose=True` and tracing

---

## 4. Memory and State
- Memory types:
  - `ConversationBufferMemory`
  - `ConversationSummaryMemory`
  - `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`
- Long-context management through summarization
- Example: chatbot with persistent memory

---

## 5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Document loaders: `TextLoader`, `PyPDFLoader`, `WebBaseLoader`
- Text splitting and chunking
- Embeddings and vector stores:
  - `Chroma`, `FAISS`, `Qdrant`
- Retrieval pipeline: retriever → LLM → Output Parser
- Example: Document Question-Answering system

---

## 6. Output Parsers
- Built-in parsers:
- `StrOutputParser`
- `PydanticOutputParser`
- `StructuredOutputParser`
- Enforcing structured outputs (e.g., JSON)
- Custom parser creation
- Error handling and fallback logic

---

## 7. Tools and Agents
- Agent concept: combining LLM, tools, and memory
- Building agents with:
- `initialize_agent`
- `AgentExecutor`
- Common tools:
- `SerpAPI`, `LLMMathChain`, `PythonREPLTool`
- Creating custom tools with the `@tool` decorator
- Multi-tool and planning agents:
- ReAct, MRKL, Plan-and-Execute architectures

---

## 8. LangGraph (Advanced LangChain)
- Graph-based orchestration of chains and agents
- Core concepts:
- Node, Edge, State, Graph
- Building reusable workflows with LangGraph Studio
- Example: multi-agent coordination graph

---

## 9. Monitoring and Debugging
- Using LangSmith for tracing and evaluation
- Tracking runs, token costs, and performance
- Optimization techniques
- Prompt analysis and latency measurement

---

## 10. Integrations and APIs
- Supported model providers:
- OpenAI, Gemini, Hugging Face, Mistral, Ollama
- Local LLMs: `Ollama`, `LM Studio`
- Building API services with LangServe
- Integrating with frontends: Streamlit, Gradio

---

## 11. End-to-End Projects
Practical projects to reinforce learning:

| Project | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| Document Q&A Bot | Upload and query documents using RAG |
| Multi-Agent System | Researcher, Summarizer, and Planner agents |
| Knowledge Base Assistant | Context-aware enterprise chatbot |
| Web Search Agent | Retrieval-powered assistant using tools |
| Memory Chatbot | Persistent multi-turn conversation model |

---

## 12. Deployment and Optimization
- Deploy LangChain APIs using LangServe
- Containerize with Docker
- Use caching and async chains for faster response
- Production best practices:
- Logging, monitoring, fallback models

---

## Summary
After completing this roadmap, you will be able to:
- Design complex chain-based workflows  
- Build retrieval and reasoning agents  
- Integrate multiple AI tools and APIs  
- Deploy full-scale LLM applications for production use
